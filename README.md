# 🧪 MiniNumPy — My Journey into Python & Arrays

This project is my personal attempt to rebuild core NumPy functionality from scratch — one step at a time.

I'm using this as a learning playground to explore:
- How operator overloading works in Python (`__add__`, `__mul__`, etc.)
- How to mimic array broadcasting and element-wise operations
- The inner workings of libraries I’ve used for years

🛠️ **Everything in this project is hand-typed**, line by line.  
No code generators, no copilot, no GPT. (Okay, I did copy-paste a few test cases 😅)  
I wanted to feel the pain and joy of writing every function myself.

The code is always a work in progress. It might break. It might be messy.  
But it’s teaching me a lot — and that’s the point.

Thanks for your patience, and feel free to explore or suggest ideas! 🙏
